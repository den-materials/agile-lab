<!-- Didn't get to this till 10:45, otherwise timing pretty spot-on -->

# Agile Practices Lab

<!--Second time 10:45, but didn't do tic-tac-toe priority and sizing yet, so added in right after opening -->
<!--10:30 5 minutes -->

## Why is this important?

__This lab is important because:__

Well-planned projects are easier to implement. By spending some time working on how you'll work through a 
project you can often finish a project easier.

## What are the objectives 

__After this workshop, developers should have__ 

* **Completed** cards outlining the user stories to complete their project
* **Completed** wireframe of their project.
* **Prioritized** stories for their project.
* **Created** a README to help outline the technical aspects of their project.

## User Stories 
### Sign up for Trello
1. Go to [www.trello.com](www.trello.com).
2. Click ``Get Started``.
3. Enter in a username, email, and password.
4. Click `create a new board`.

<!--10:40 15 minutes -->

### Write at least 5 user stories
Creating a kanban Trello board.

1. Click on the `Add a list` field.
2. Enter "To Do"
3. Add another list for "Doing" and "Done"
4. Click ``Add a card`` in the "To Do" list 
5. Enter your first story in an ``A <User> can <feature> so that <purpose>`` format.
6. Add a checklist to the story by clicking the pencil icon and then the checklist button
6. Add any specific task to the list like creating a button in HTML or adding an event listener.
7. Give the story a number of points by using a label.

Take 15 minutes and create at least 5 user stories for your project. Remember that smaller stories are
better in general than more complicated stories.

Don't worry about order yet, just about defining the features you plan to work on. Also feel free 
to include stretch goals in the stories as well. Also don't worry about getting the perfect size, rough 
sizes are what we're looking for at this point.

Tips: 
You can reorder your lists by dragging and dropping individual cards.

## Prioritize Stories
Take a few minutes to prioritize your stories. If you added a new story based on your wireframes just make 
sure at least your title is included on a story card. Put the first story you plan to work on top of the 
list and then the next story you plan to do under it.

<!--Actually 11:18 -->
<!--11:00 10 minutes -->

Take a few minutes to review your partner's user story list. Do the stories make sense? Do the stories 
describe features or just technical tasks?

Take a few minutes to discuss with your partner any feedback on their user stories.

<!--11:10 15 minutes -->

## Wireframes
Take a few minutes to re-sketch your simple wireframe of your app. Remember, it doesn't matter how good the 
wireframe looks. It matters that it catches all the major relevant features. You can draw your wireframe 
on paper, on the whiteboard, or use a wireframing tool mentioned in [the previous lesson](https://github.com/den-wdi-2/software-development-best-practices).

Take a few minutes to review your wireframe. Does every button or input map to a user story? Do you need to 
add new stories?

<!--Actually 11:35 -->
<!--11:25 5 minutes -->

## Keeping Track 
1. Create a Github repo for your project
2. Create a README file for your repo. (The GitHub webpage allows you to use a GUI to create one.)
3. Add a link to your Trello board in the README
4. Add a picture of your Wireframe to your README

## Wrap-up
Project organizaton is often one of the key ways software organization can become more efficent. 
Learning how to think in common agile processes helps prepare you to work on teams in the future.
